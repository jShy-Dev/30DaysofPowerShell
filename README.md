# 30DaysofPowerShell

## Please note: 
This is an old project that Ive revived and tweaked to help teach my son how use Powershell for administration and automation tasks. 
I designed the content to get progressively more complex but ive stretched the content a bit to make 30 days worth of topics and practice.
We will be updating the repo as frequently as life and free time allows - a true script kiddie education.
Follow along with my son and I as we complete a 30 day PowerShell learning challenge.
